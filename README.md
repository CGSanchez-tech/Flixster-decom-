### Notes
Biggest challenge was keeping track of all the tabs opened in Android Studio, I had to be very aware of what exactly I was doing and how it connected with the other tabs. This helped me not get lost though, which was one of the larger issues I faced last week, especially because I'm brand new to Java. 

### Open-source libraries used
